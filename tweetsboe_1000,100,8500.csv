Would that be just like printing money? If so it would devalue the pound like crazy… what’s the point if I can already pay for things on my phone? @bankofengland explain please,2023-02-07T01:45:26.000Z;
Hi Robin, a digital pound would be a way you can access Sterling just as you would with banknotes. So, £10 of digital pounds would be worth the same as a £10 banknote. For more information on our proposal, please see our Consultation Paper:,2023-02-07T15:32:48.000Z;
The Bank of England would not be able to restrict how users’ digital pounds are spent. But innovations in technology may allow users to program their money to use it in new ways. Find out more here: https://b-o-e.uk/3XcS66Q,2023-02-07T13:57:40.000Z;
Digital pounds would be stored directly at the Bank of England, but users would access these through digital wallets offered by private companies. Find out more here: https://b-o-e.uk/3lan81X,2023-02-07T14:07:07.000Z;
Our consultation paper proposes a range of features for the digital pound that meet our objectives. Find out more about these here: https://b-o-e.uk/3JKh1vG,2023-02-07T13:52:05.000Z;
The digital pound would be designed for everyday payments by households and businesses. Find out more about the other features here: https://b-o-e.uk/3Iebnkt,2023-02-07T13:45:51.000Z;
The digital pound would be subject to rigorous standards of privacy and data protection. It would be privacy-enhancing by design and would allow users to make choices about their data. Find out more here: https://b-o-e.uk/3jxudtf,2023-02-07T13:40:14.000Z;

We’ve raised #BankRate to 4% today. Inflation has started to fall, but it is still much too high. Raising interest rates is the best way we have to ensure low and stable inflation. Andrew Bailey explains more below. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023,2023-02-02T13:35:29.000Z;
The Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 7-2 to raise #BankRate to 4%. Find out more in our #MonetaryPolicyReport: https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023,2023-02-02T12:01:10.000Z;
We expect inflation to fall quickly this year. It’s our job to make sure that inflation returns to our 2% target. Low and stable inflation is vital for a healthy economy. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023 #MonetaryPolicyReport,2023-02-02T12:13:38.000Z;
We’ve put up interest rates to make sure inflation falls and stays low. Raising interest rates is the best way we have to bring inflation down. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023 #MonetaryPolicyReport,2023-02-02T12:19:00.000Z;
Inflation has begun to fall, but it’s still well above our 2% target. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023 #MonetaryPolicyReport,2023-02-02T12:09:02.000Z;

Inflation is currently elevated, especially for essential goods such as energy and food. To curb inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee has been raising Bank Rate, which means that many households will face higher borrowing costs on their mortgages. https://b-o-e.uk/3GXpCrW,2023-01-20T14:38:29.000Z;

Just curious and may be a stupid question, you will print the banknotes as required ( new, torn banknotes, etc ) or you will start removing of circulation the old notes and eventually replace all the notes?,2023-01-11T16:22:35.000Z;
The new banknotes will only be printed to replace those that are worn and to meet any overall increase in demand for banknotes. Our approach is in line with guidance from the Royal Household, to minimise the environmental and financial impact of this change.,2023-01-12T10:54:48.000Z;
Huw Pill discusses the unique combination of challenges facing the UK economy, and explains what this might mean for inflation in the months ahead. https://b-o-e.uk/3in3Pld,2023-01-09T16:31:52.000Z;

@bankofengland For the recently unveild J.R.R Tolkien commemoration coin, how would someone outside the UK get one? I don't think circulation would reach Denmark.,2022-12-29T15:31:16.000Z;
Hi, here at the Bank of England we are only responsible for banknotes. Any questions regarding coins should be directed to the Royal Mint: @RoyalMintUK  I hope this helps.,2023-01-02T18:27:36.000Z;
I know you're going to say that it's St Edwards Crown, coronation etc, but . . . I think it's just an oversight really? I think the Tudor Crown as per the cypher would make more sense.,2022-12-21T13:32:31.000Z;
To confirm, this is not an oversight and was intentional.  The foil on our banknotes depicts St. Edward’s Crown as this is the Coronation Crown and the centre piece of the Crown Jewels, rather than the crown on the King’s cypher.,2022-12-21T14:51:17.000Z;
Sorry, but that doesn't look anything like Charles. He's not that ugly that you couldn't have used a more recent photo of him. It does him no honour at all, just says you're ashamed of how he looks.,2022-12-21T06:41:39.000Z;
The image of King Charles III is based on a photograph owned by the Royal Household which was provided to the Bank in 2013.  The engraved portrait image on the banknotes was created by De La Rue in collaboration with the Bank, to His Majesty’s approval.,2022-12-21T10:32:47.000Z;
