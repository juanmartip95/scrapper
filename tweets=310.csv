We’ve raised #BankRate to 4% today. Inflation has started to fall, but it is still much too high. Raising interest rates is the best way we have to ensure low and stable inflation. Andrew Bailey explains more below. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023,2023-02-02T13:35:29.000Z;
The Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 7-2 to raise #BankRate to 4%. Find out more in our #MonetaryPolicyReport: https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023,2023-02-02T12:01:10.000Z;
We expect inflation to fall quickly this year. It’s our job to make sure that inflation returns to our 2% target. Low and stable inflation is vital for a healthy economy. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023 #MonetaryPolicyReport,2023-02-02T12:13:38.000Z;
We’ve put up interest rates to make sure inflation falls and stays low. Raising interest rates is the best way we have to bring inflation down. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023 #MonetaryPolicyReport,2023-02-02T12:19:00.000Z;
Inflation has begun to fall, but it’s still well above our 2% target. https://b-o-e.uk/MPR-Feb-2023 #MonetaryPolicyReport,2023-02-02T12:09:02.000Z;

Inflation is currently elevated, especially for essential goods such as energy and food. To curb inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee has been raising Bank Rate, which means that many households will face higher borrowing costs on their mortgages. https://b-o-e.uk/3GXpCrW,2023-01-20T14:38:29.000Z;

Just curious and may be a stupid question, you will print the banknotes as required ( new, torn banknotes, etc ) or you will start removing of circulation the old notes and eventually replace all the notes?,2023-01-11T16:22:35.000Z;
The new banknotes will only be printed to replace those that are worn and to meet any overall increase in demand for banknotes. Our approach is in line with guidance from the Royal Household, to minimise the environmental and financial impact of this change.,2023-01-12T10:54:48.000Z;
Huw Pill discusses the unique combination of challenges facing the UK economy, and explains what this might mean for inflation in the months ahead. https://b-o-e.uk/3in3Pld,2023-01-09T16:31:52.000Z;

@bankofengland For the recently unveild J.R.R Tolkien commemoration coin, how would someone outside the UK get one? I don't think circulation would reach Denmark.,2022-12-29T15:31:16.000Z;
Hi, here at the Bank of England we are only responsible for banknotes. Any questions regarding coins should be directed to the Royal Mint: @RoyalMintUK  I hope this helps.,2023-01-02T18:27:36.000Z;
I know you're going to say that it's St Edwards Crown, coronation etc, but . . . I think it's just an oversight really? I think the Tudor Crown as per the cypher would make more sense.,2022-12-21T13:32:31.000Z;
To confirm, this is not an oversight and was intentional.  The foil on our banknotes depicts St. Edward’s Crown as this is the Coronation Crown and the centre piece of the Crown Jewels, rather than the crown on the King’s cypher.,2022-12-21T14:51:17.000Z;
Sorry, but that doesn't look anything like Charles. He's not that ugly that you couldn't have used a more recent photo of him. It does him no honour at all, just says you're ashamed of how he looks.,2022-12-21T06:41:39.000Z;
The image of King Charles III is based on a photograph owned by the Royal Household which was provided to the Bank in 2013.  The engraved portrait image on the banknotes was created by De La Rue in collaboration with the Bank, to His Majesty’s approval.,2022-12-21T10:32:47.000Z;

Our latest Financial Stability Report sets out what we are doing to aim to ensure the UK’s financial system stays strong. https://b-o-e.uk/FSR-Dec-22 #FinancialStabilityReport,2022-12-13T10:31:43.000Z;
UK banks are strong enough to support households and businesses. https://b-o-e.uk/FSR-Dec-22 #FinancialStabilityReport,2022-12-13T11:03:24.000Z;
Rapid and large moves in the interest rates on UK government debt (gilts) caused stress in a particular non-bank sector (LDI funds). We temporarily bought gilts to reduce this stress and we are working to strengthen the wider financial system. https://b-o-e.uk/FSR-Dec-22,2022-12-13T11:09:03.000Z;
The #FinancialStabilityReport press conference will begin shortly. Watch here:,2022-12-13T10:56:02.000Z;

UK households are facing even more financial pressure, in part because of rising mortgage rates. https://b-o-e.uk/FSR-Dec-22 #FinancialStabilityReport,2022-12-13T10:46:00.000Z;

@bankofengland The public DO NOT want this. This is full control of peoples money arbitrarily to ban freeze or programme how WE will be able to spend OUR money? Expiry dates on currency forcing us to spend?CBDC is the social credit system that ends our financial freedom.,2022-12-12T09:53:56.000Z;
The Bank and the Government have not taken a decision to introduce a CBDC, but are actively exploring the topic and the design. We are still committed to the continued access to cash and any possible future CBDC would complement existing payment methods, not replace them.,2022-12-12T11:27:25.000Z;
@bankofengland Why are you insisting on increasing interest rates when inflation is being driven by supply NOT demand?? @RishiSunak @Jeremy_Hunt @Conservatives @TalkTV @GBNEWS @BBCNews,2022-12-11T17:24:58.000Z;
The Monetary Policy Committee will meet this week to decide on the appropriate level of interest rates but at their last meeting, this is why they increased rates,,2022-12-12T09:08:25.000Z;
If your notes are the ones shown here, https://b-o-e.uk/3VZWRRgthen there is no need to change them as they are still our current notes.,2022-12-12T09:08:02.000Z;

@bankofengland where can I swap out paper bills for polymer bills while in North America? Tried a currency exchange but no luck.,2022-11-19T02:20:11.000Z;

@bankofengland , barclays bank today asked me to pose with my passport so that they can take a photo, and store it for KYC, this is demeaning and I felt like criminal posing for a mug shot, is this legal ? I felt vulnerable and powerless at this act.,2022-11-07T13:45:26.000Z;
I'm afraid I'm unable to advise you on this. The regulation of such conduct is overseen by the FCA who have the responsibility to ensure customers are protected and can bank securely. If you have concerns, I recommend speaking to the FCA or Barclays directly.,2022-11-07T14:18:24.000Z;

Hi Daniel, the £5 note is the only polymer note without a tactile feature in the top left hand corner. The absence of a tactile feature helps blind and partially sighted people identify the value of the note.,2022-10-31T09:19:13.000Z;

Do seek further advice from the post office, an international exchange counter or the central bank who issued the notes.,2022-10-24T09:14:16.000Z;
it would be good if you removed the PROMISE TO PAY from your notes because you pay NOTHING.,2022-10-21T11:09:20.000Z;
This phrase dates from long ago when our notes represented deposits of gold. The value of the pound hasn't been linked to gold for many years, so the meaning of the promise to pay has changed. You can only exchange notes for other Bank of England notes of the same face value.,2022-10-21T12:46:34.000Z;
