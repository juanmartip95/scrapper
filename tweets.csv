"The left-subscript denotes the size of the conjugacy class.  Note that the C3-class and the ""large V4-class"" are both contained in D_6 and S_4, which is why this isn't a lattice.  Technically, the name ""reduced subgroup lattice"" doesn't mean it's actually a lattice. Is that okay?"
"They're not closed under joins, but what about meets?"
"For almost the entire month so far, I've been in Redding CA, preparing to move my father into assisted living. Without going into details, he ended up in the hospital and is now in a rehab center. He caught covid at one of those places and I probably caught it from him."
I'm wishing you and your father all the best!!
"Thank you, Spencer, that means a lot to me"
"It's almost overwhelming how many things need doing: forms to fill out, scheduling movers, getting power of attorney, prepping his house for sale, etc. I'm looking at my to-do list for today and anything mathematically related (writing referee reports) is way down at the bottom."
"Anyway, while this is going on, I wish every one of you the very best and I sincerely hope that life is treating you well, or at least acceptably."
"I'm thankful that my department chair and my students were ok with my pivoting classes to online. My dad never had internet installed in his house (hasn't touched a computer since 1989), so I've been, uh, borrowing wi-fi wherever I can."
"Thanks to paxlovid, we are both testing negative. (Fingers crossed neither of us has the rebound side effect.) This means he can get back to physical therapy and will hopefully be ready to move on the 30th. I need to head home on the 31st."
What's your favorite interval of ℝ that is closed under multiplication?

"Is it weird that every time I read the name ""Frobenius,"" my brain thinks it sounds like a dance?"
Everybody do the Frobenius!
I think it sounds like a good wizard from the first phase of an epic quest; a supportive NPC or even the questgiver.
"Yes, it sounds like that too! It's a remarkably versatile name"
"There may not be a field of order 6, but there is a meadow of order 6..."
"I'd like one too. I'll be pronouncing it as ""another time sink"""
"Anyone have a bluesky invite? Fair warning, I will be pronouncing it like “brewski.”"
Got the hookup! Same username.
Cool. Looks a little more promising than Spoutible

"Incidentally, the obituary's request for memorial contributions hints that Light may have been a descendant of the John Light for whom Light's Fort is named.

"To end with mathematics once again, here is the Wikipedia article on Light's Associativity Test. (It is badly in need of some rewriting.)

"Based on the addresses in Light's papers, I think he retired sometime between 1973 and 1976, because he moved to Pennsylvania in that period. He died in 2007 at the age of 99. More information about his life can be found in his obituary.

"If you are wondering why I haven't shown you a photograph of Light, it's because I wasn't able to find one. I have no idea if Michael Adler resembled him or not.

"Light's testimony was shown in the 2003 movie ""The Commission."" Light was portrayed by actor Michael Adler. I have never seen the film, but I somehow doubt that Light's comment about studying mathematics made it in.

"The Edgewood group was asked to assess the wounds of President Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally; hence Light's testimony. I'll leave the details of their findings to your reading.
